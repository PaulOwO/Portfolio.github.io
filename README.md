We are going to see overall how the scene evolved throughout 2 months and thanks to which techniques.

## The setup

- First of all this project was done for the module GPR3500 at the SAE institute of Geneva.
- The project was done on [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org) which allows us to do graphics programming on a lot of platforms.
- We used [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) to create our application window and take input.
- In addition to our course, we used the site [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) to help us through  programming.

Each week we saw different graphic programming techniques and had to implement thus we needed/wanted in our final scene.
So let's get started!

## Triangle

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179834437-2a24b254-5f40-4dd4-8f94-b45891c4b820.png)

We started with a triangle, the simplest shape that we use to create every object in the scene.
We created our first shader, Vertex Buffer Objects, Array Buffer Objects and uniform and with that we had some kind of basis.

## Square

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179768462-facfb500-d9c9-48a9-bc36-859986572c28.png)

To make a square we learned about indices and Elements Buffer Objects that allow us not to draw again the part of our triangle that would overlap.


## Texture

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179745115-248daba2-09db-4006-a679-e35d046dd60c.png)

To apply texture, we first need to load and bind it using multiple openGl commands, then give the texture coordinates to our shader.

## Cube 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179782553-dd2f8e6b-6a78-439e-812e-16fabe0c14d4.png)

Then we did 3d for the first time by adding some vertices and indices plus creating a model, view and projection matrix to locate it in our space. 

## Lighting 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179768731-092ceabe-0103-487c-b858-e8a18b145df6.png)

Lighting is done with the help of the light position/direction and by setting uniforms for the power of three different light components.

The ambient light is the color of the object when it isn't directly lit.

The diffuse light is the color of the object when it is directly lit.

The specular is when the normal of the object goes directly in our eye (the camera), it gives this really bright point.

For our lighting to work we also need it to work with multiple and different sources of light.
We calculate how each light has an impact on the object (by changing it's anbient, diffuse, specular) and add it together.

In our scene there are currently three lights.

A directional light creates parallel light in a direction (like the sun). 

A point light sends light all around it (like a lamp). 

A spotlight that acts like a point light but only in one direction (in our scene it's the camera direction so it's like a flashlight). 

Each object also have a material that tells how the object should react to light.

Lighting map/specular map

A specular map tells if the object should or should not have a specular.

## Model

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179769376-0a20b970-ce75-4f99-a1b4-1fa72236a0d5.png)

We load the data of our model (vertex, texture coordinate, etc...) from all sorts of formats like ".obj". Thanks to assimp we can access the data easily and draw each mesh that constitute our model.

## Frame Buffer 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179769553-ccf5a45b-4021-4e83-9a1d-ee6cf223a8a0.png)

Frame Buffers allow us to draw things on a different buffer than the one we show at the end. We use this buffer to store what we draw as a new texture we can use later. In this case we drew our entire scene in a framebuffer, turned it into a texture then applied some effect on it.

## Stencil

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179769841-d4e823a4-d38a-47ef-9be8-522a64f61c55.png)

A stencil is a buffer that can be written on and that can discard fragments.
In our scene we draw again our model a bit larger and discard what's in front of our smaller model. We get an outline.

## Cube Mapping

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179770334-0d911b0e-7840-43f9-a475-c540f59a7855.png)

Cube mapping allows us to create a cube of texture with six textures.

In our case we use it to make a skybox.

## Instancing

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179776948-b769951f-5abd-42ce-88fe-2d4bd4e9cbda.png)

Instancing is an optimization that allows us to use one draw call for the same object .

## Normal Mapping

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179770099-59ef1fc3-2ee6-49d2-9148-bd05f2edcd13.png)

We use normal mapping to create the illusion of depth thanks to lighting.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179773353-c38ca374-4762-45d8-8b08-7f4dbe8b0d89.png) 

Normal maps

A normal map is used to redefine the normals of our object that we use in our light calculation. We can create more details without adding any triangles.  

## Shadow Mapping

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179770514-ea955139-1a51-4ce1-baef-87f5ee616ede.png)

Shadow mapping is used to create shadow!

To do so we bind a framebuffer then draw our scene from the point of view of our light in depth only. Then we draw in another buffer the scene normally with our shadow map that we just got.

In our case the light being a directional light doesn't have a position so we made an approximation to have it cover our scene.

Shadow map

## Final Scene

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179767972-c7dbc421-7940-4034-84d6-7f6214cd5a84.png)

From what we saw before, let's see what elements we put in our scene :

- Lighting : directional light, point light (white square), flashlight.
- Ground : square, instanced and using normal mapping.
- Backpack : model, instanced and using normal mapping.
- Shadow mapping : from directional lighting.
- Cube mapping : skybox.
- Frame Buffer : alter between normal and blurry every 5 seconds.
- Back Face Culling (see in "view frustum culling").  

## What more could have been done

### View frustum culling
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71375990/179771229-966a2c75-50d0-440b-b3d1-3879989746c8.png)

In the current scene the only "camera view" optimization is the backface culling that does not draw the back of the object.
View frustum culling is an optimization that allows objects that are not in the camera to be not drawn and it's one I would have liked to have in my scene.

### Shadow Cube Mapping

As previously said in "Shadow Mapping '', my shadow only works for directional lighting. We could make it work for a point light by creating a cube map of shadow map, it means that we would have to draw a scene from six different points of view.


## What's next

To go deeper into graphics programming there are multiple things that could be done, the first one being finishing the scene with some more effect and adding PBR that is the lighting technique mostly used in the industry. Then the next step would be to do the scene again but in DirectX 11 to learn many things!

## Conclusion 

That's it for the overview of my scene, we saw all the techniques i used and what they do in the scene.
I appreciated this course and can't wait to learn about more techniques used in the industry.
